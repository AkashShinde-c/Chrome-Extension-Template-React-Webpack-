This is a starter template for building a Chrome extension using React and Webpack. It provides a basis for starting to build your extension in a familiar environment with modern JavaScript tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

    ```bash
    cd chrome-extension-template

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

### Usage

    npm run build
    
    This command will create a production-ready bundle of your extension in the `dist` directory.

### Installing the Chrome Extension

1. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
3. Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
